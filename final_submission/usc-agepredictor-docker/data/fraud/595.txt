The lives of myself and my children are at risk ever since my husband engaged himself in this rebel of a thing in my country which later saw him as the president of my country. We have currently been offered political assylum in the Federal Republic Of Nigeria by its President,Olusegun Obasanjo,which will confine us to its shores for the rest of our lives. I have been assured safety by the United states Government and that of the Nigerian Government by a meeting held with both Presidents,President George Bush Of the United States and that of the Nigerian President on the 10th of July 2003 at the just concluded Leon Sullivan Summit Held In Nigeria.. What you may hear of my husband should you decide to verify may not be of a good report but he has learnt his lesson the hard way and what i do now i do for the sake of my two daughters and son whom i pray to God to forgive them from the retribution of the sins of their farther.
