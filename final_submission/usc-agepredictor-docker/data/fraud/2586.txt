Hello 77 Seaside Cottages Fish Hoek-Cape Town South Africa Tel:+874-763427915 or +874-763427918 Fax:+874-763427916 Hello, READ CAREFULLY PLEASE For this letter is strictly personal, intimate and confidential. Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter is of exceptional and very private nature. There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this email, coupled with the fact that, so many miscreants have taken possession of the Internet to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficult for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition. There is no way for me to know whether I will be properly understood, but it is my duty to write and reach out to you. For I know that you are the only one that can be trusted to handle this project effectively without making me regret. Though this approach appears desperate, difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing this fund. My name is Bona Ken, I am the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on 18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASH with the whole passengers aboard. There is an account opened in this bank in 2000 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company. The total amount involved is 116,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and Sixteen Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $16,000,000.00 [Sixteen Million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account. I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account, which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclussion of the transfer 60% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 25% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly send me e-mail . You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication. Respectfully yours, Bona Ken. ______________________________________ Platíte zbyteènì drahé povinné ruèení? Zjistìte si cenu v online kalkulaèce nebo na tel. 841 444 444.
