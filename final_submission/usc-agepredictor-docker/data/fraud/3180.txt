From Cynthia. From: Mrs. Rose D. Aboka, Greetings in the name of God. Please let this not sound strange to you. I am deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the bream! set which also affected my brain, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that according to my doctors they have advised me that I may not live for the next six months, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought upfrom a motherless baby&#65533;s home, married to my late husband for twenty years without a child. My husband died in a fatal motor accident.Before his death we were true Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited the sum of US$3 million dollars with a Security Company here in Abidjan. Presently this money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money or issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over because of my illness. Presently I'm with my lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless baby&#65533;s home where I come from. I want you God fearing to also use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows. If you are interested, please respond back to my proposal so that I will give you security firm contact, They will issue you the letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Full names_________________ Contact Address________________ Telephone/fax numbers____________ God bless you.
