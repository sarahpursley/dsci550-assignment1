Pls Reply Respectfully Greeting You, How are you and your family? I hope all of you are fine. This should surprise you because you don't know me and I don't know you. Nevertheless, it is my pleasure contacting you for the investment I intended to do in your country. I am Sadou K. Hamal and I am 25 years of age. Though I have not met you, considering my situation now I risk confiding in you for my survival because I have that conviction of trusting in you. There is this eighteen million dollar ( USd18m) my late father deposited in Deposit House before he was assassinated by unspecified rebels.Unfortunately, after few months my mother also was murdered.So, I ran away, but now, I have decided to invest this fund in yourcountry or anywhere safer, outside Africa for security and political purposes. I want your help to transfer and invest the fund in your country, hence I contacted you. Also I will like to continue my education in your country, while you will manage the investment of the fund in a good business. Then you will be getting 30% of the profit of the investment. I will give you further details when you reply. My warm greetings to your family. Respectfully Yours, Sadou
