RE TREAT AS URGENT Hello I will want you to be of good assistance to me, i know we have not meet before or have any conversation before, however i will want you to bear with me and be of good assistance to my request. Be informed that i am working in a Bank here in Abidjan, and in our remittance department, the sum of $1,000,000.00 United State Dollars was deposited by one late Mrs. Roseline Johnson, that was working with United Nation. And for your information, nobody knows about this money, because i am the director of our remittance department, and i will want you to reply me with your telephone and fax number together with your full resident address, so it will enable me to write 4 cheque's of $250,000.00 Each, and have it send to you by DHL, and for your information, i am going to give you the sum of $200,000.00 from the total sum as soon as the cheque is be clear in your account.
