This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it's success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard this transaction. I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account. The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$100,000,000.00 (One hundred Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$115,500,000.00 (One hundred and Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.
