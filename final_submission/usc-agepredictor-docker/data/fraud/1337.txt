PROJECT. Dear Sir/Madam, Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics. I will introduce myself as a staff in the accounts management section of a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom. One of our accounts with holding balance of £15,000,000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 4 years. >From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account a foreigner by name Austin Martins died in August 2000 and since then nobody has done anything As regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds. Also Information From the National Immigration states that he was also single on entry into the UK. I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do Business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you. Regards, Gordon. DISCLAIMER: This message contains confidential information and is intended only for specified addressee.
