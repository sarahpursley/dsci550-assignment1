Your assistance is highly needed as our life are highly in danger. Mrs.Lydia Johnson C/o Eglise Ouganda (Catholic church ) Liberte Sicap 1,Dakar Senegal Hello,Good Day. Compliment of the season. I know this mail will come to you as a surprise. Nevertheless I am Mrs.Lydia Johnson, the wife of Major Doncan Johnson, Chief Security Officer and Aide-deâ€“camp to the exiled president Charles Tailor of Liberia. As a result of the on-going problem in my country, I am saddled with problems of my ill-health of protracted diabetes and high blood pressure which is getting of increase in the recent times, more importantly getting a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the sum of US$8Million deposited/registered inform of a consignment contained with computer accessories for security reason with a secuirty company on my name as the next of kin to my late husband which I intend to invest in your country. Due to this crises presently in my city Monrovia our home town, I managed to sneak myself, my only son Patrick 23 years old and my daughters out of Monrovia to Dakar senegal for safety. We were sneaked into Dakar Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some government militant group. After the killing of my husband by the rebels, we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to secure the said deposit made in this country by my husband and to also look for a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the deposit which has being deposited here in Dakar Senegal before he was killed by the heartless rebels. I feel confident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition as all our foreign contacts and connections got lost during this crises, all properties burnt by the rebels. I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this huge deposit to your country for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of my family. For your percentage for assistance, a negotiable percentage will be discussed as soon as I receive your response based on this plead for your assistance as our lives are highly in danger due to this problem. I pray and plead for your help. Please endavour to email me back for further clarifications over this issue. God bless you as you respond to my plea for assistance.Our telephone will be open for your call any time but if I am not available at the time of your call, my son Patrick will respond to you accordingly. Yours truly. Mrs Lydia Johnson.
