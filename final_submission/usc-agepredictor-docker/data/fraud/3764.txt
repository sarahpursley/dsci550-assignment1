Since then I have made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but has been unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the internet,to see if I could locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.Of particular interest is this huge deposit with our bank here in my country Cote Diviore,where the deceased has an account valued at about ($16 million US dollars).They have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or our bank will declare the account unservisable and thereby send the funds to the bank treasury. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over last 7 years now, I will seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last names, so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($16million US dollars) can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. In your reply mail, I want you to give me your full names, address, date of birth, telephone and fax numbers.If you can handle this with me, reach me for more details.
