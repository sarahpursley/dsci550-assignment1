I need your help Attn: I am Mr. Jacko Maree the C.E.O of Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Dakar,Senegal. However I got your contact from the web during my search for help.I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private. Recently I discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued US$31,823,000.00 USD[Thirty one million eight hundred and twenty three thousand United States Dollars] that belongs to one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash .During my investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska,who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; <http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/> The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before my discovery of this development.The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for ten years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.In order to avert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiaryÂ´s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris Thompson. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as civil servant,I am not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose. On smooth conclusion of this transaction,55% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 30% of the total transfered sum,10% for charity both in Senegal and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish the operation.Bear in mind that this transaction is 100% risk free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. PLEASE,THE CONTENT OF THIS LETTER IS A TOP SECRET AND I WILL WANT YOU TO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF ONLY. Sincerely yours, Mr. Maree Jacko.
