Re: Monkey costumes No luck this weekend with light colored or brown sweats. We looked in the mall, target and kohl's and only some dark colored sweats. There are lots of clothes in khaki colored - could we use pants or shorts this color? Namita -------------- Original message -------------- Hi Everyone, I still have not had any luck with brown clothing for the monkey costumes (sweats, tees, jeans, etc). In case anyone needs adhesive felt, Joann Fabrics at Oak Valley has sheets of dark brown adhesive felt (8-1/2 x 11 inches) . They also have fuzzy brown felt for $4.99 a yard. Has anyone come across pale yellow or white sweats? We could always dye the white sweats brown (just an idea). Laura
