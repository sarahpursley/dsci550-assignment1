LOOKING FOR PARTNERSHIP Good day Sir, I am so sorry for sending you this unsolicited and unexpected mail. I got your contact from a Business directory in my agents office and I decided to contact you directly for the sake of business. My full Name is Francis Williams.I am searching for a reliable and experience business partner. I have about $4.3 Million Dollars with me and I would want to develop it and then invest it here in U.A.E or Europe under your guidance. So I am only soliciting for your assistance to help me develop the currency. My Business is totally free of risk and trouble. If you are willing to invest in this business please give me your confidential contact phone number so that we can see face to face and discuss in details. Thank you once again for your interest and waiting for your reply. Best Regards, Francis Williams,
