Those funds was deposited in there bank in 2002 by some African top politicians who used their position in their offices to embezzle government treasury some of those politicians ran away from their country as soon as new government took over power to avoid probing them for their misappropriation and embezzlement of government funds. The new government in power has ordered for the confiscation of their properties including their bank accounts for their evil operation.
