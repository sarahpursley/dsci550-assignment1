I have been working with this company for over ten years. Within this period, I have watched with meticulous precision how African Heads of State and Government functionaries have been using global security & finance Ltd. to move sums of money USD, pounds sterling, French francs (cash) to their foreign partners. They bring in these consignments of cash and secretly declare the contents as jewelries, Gold, Diamonds, Precious stones, Family treasures, and documents etc. Gen.

Sankoy of Sierra Leone, Babangida of Nigeria, Felix Houphet Boigny of Cote d' Ivore (dead), Kanan Bedie of Cote d' Ivore (Abidjan) etc. All these people have hundreds of consignments deposited with my office. Their foreign partners, friends and relatives are claiming most of these consignments. A lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much as eight years. Nobody will ever come for them because in most cases, the certificate of Deposit are never available to any body except the depositors or with me hence most of them are dead. I have Re-deposited all these overstayed consignment into the Vault Facility of Reputable Bank in Ghana waiting to hear from you. Since the inception of the year 2000, our company's management has changed the procedure of claims of consignment, as soon as you are able to produce the secret information as contained in the secret file of any consignment, it will be released to you upon demand.

Abacha died in a plane crash and the second son (Mohammed) is facing a murder charge and embezzlement, the family members are under house arrest without communication with the outside world. I have finalized every arrangement for you to come and claim consignment No: 1401, 1402 containing $46 million.
