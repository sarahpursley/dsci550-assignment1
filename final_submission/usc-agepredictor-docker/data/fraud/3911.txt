BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO Dear, I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15.5 (fiftteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars) in an account that belongs to one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
