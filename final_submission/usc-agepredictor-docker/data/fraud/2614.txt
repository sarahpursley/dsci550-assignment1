Odtad listy do mnie nalezy wysylac na adres: maria_denise55@yahoo.pl FROM MISS MARIA DENISE ADDRESS/ AVE 11 RUE 45 ABIDJAN COTE D IVOIRE Dearest Beloved Base on your profile i am happy to request for your assistance and also to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you. I am MISS maria denise,20years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS denise My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in th! e capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political c! risis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sor row to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask you these question:- (1.) Can I completely trust you? Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you so much. My sincere regards, MISS maria denise. - maria denise
