Please......Assist DEAR GREETINGS AND GOD'S MOST CHERISHED BLESSINGS. I WAS FORMERLY MRS.HAFSAT ABN ABDULLAH, A WIDOW TO LATE SHEIK ABN ABDULLAH I AM 61 YEARS OLD. I AM NOW A NEW CHRISTAIN CONVERT AND HAS CHANGED MY NAME TO JANE ABDULLAH SO I AM ADDRESED AS MRS.JANE ABDULLAH. I AM SUFFERING FROM LONG TIME CANCER OF THE BREAST, FROM ALL INDICATION MY CONDITIONS IS REALLY DETERIORATING AND IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT I WON’T LIVE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS, ACCORDING TO MY DOCTORS, THIS IS BECAUSE THE CANCER STAGE HAS GOTTEN TO A VERY BAD STAGE. MY LATE WAS HUSBAND KILLED DURING THE U.S. RAID AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN, AND DURING THE PERIOD OF OUR MARRIAGE WE COULD’NT PRODUCE ANY CHILD, HENCE WE ADOPTED ONE CHILD, A SON NOW GOING TO 17 YEARS. MY LATE HUSBAND WAS VERY WEALTHY AND AFTER HIS DEATH, I INHERITED ALL HIS BUSINESS AND WEALTH. THE DOCTORS HAS ADVISED ME THAT I MAY NOT LIVE FOR MORE THAN 3 MOTHS, SO I NOW DECIDED TO DEVIDE THE PART OF THIS WEALTH. FOR THE FACT THAT OUR ONLY SON IS TOO YOUNG TO CLAIM AND INVEST PROPERLY THE FUND/CONSIGNMENT, I NOW SELECTED YOU AFTER VISITING THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY AND I PRAYED OVER IT. I HAVE THE SUM OF $12,000.000.00 U.S DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN A FINANCE COMPANY WHICH I WILL WANT YOU TO RECEIVE AND ASSIST ME IN DOING THE FOLLOWING. 1.TO SERVE AS GUARDIAN AND ASSIST OUR ONLY SON IN COMPLETING HIS EDUCATION AND ALSO INVESTING 40% OF THE TOTAL FUND FOR HIM, PENDING WHEN HE WILL BE OLD ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT. 2. I AM WILLING TO DONATE 30% OF THE TOTAL FUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE OF THE LESS PRIVILEGED AND VICTIMS OF WAR IN AFRICA, AMERICA, ASIA AND EUROPE. 3. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO 25% OF THE TOTAL FUND WHILE 5% WILL BE FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED DURING THE CAUSE OF THE TRANSACTION. AS SOON AS I RECEIVE YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE AND ONTACT PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS, I WILL THEN FILE IN AN APPLICATION FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE MONEY IN YOUR NAME. LASTLY, I HONESTLY PRAY THAT THIS MONEY WHEN TRANSFERRED WILL BE SURE FOR THE SAID PURPOSE, BECAUSE I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT THAT WEALTH ACQUISITION IS VANITY. GOD BLESS YOU AS I AWAIT YOUR REPLY. TRULY YOURS, MRS.JANE ABDULLAH. ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT_123
