In fact, he said and I quote ??y beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the sum of US$17 million. I deposited the said fund in a private account of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa; all the documents regarding the fund are with your mother. I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use.
