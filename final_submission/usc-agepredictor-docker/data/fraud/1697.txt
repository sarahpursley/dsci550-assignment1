Treat as urgent From:Isaac Ezekiel Jnr Attn: President/CEO I am Isaac Ezekiel Jnr. the only son of late former Director of finance,Chief Isaac J Ezekiel of Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation. I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this proposal. My late father had some bonds with a gold vault company in Abidjan,I have the Bond certificates and the passwords to the vaults, i am not about to tell you the password and how many bonds involved until I have your words right now I am on the run, Than is why I dont want to go back there from UK and where it got bad is that I bear the same name with my late father my mother Mrs. Mary Ezekiel and younger sister is here with me in the UK and said that I should find someone who will help me convert the gold bonds into cash or move the bonds away from Abidjan to Europe or America where it could still be converted to cash. Now the war in my country is over with the help of ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who served under the former regime and now ask countries to expel such person at the same time freeze their account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note that I am contacting you, all I need from you is your Trust. I am offering you 20 % of the total bonds, now all my hope is banked on your trust and I really wants to invest this money a country, were their is stability of Government, political and economic welfare. Dont be alarmed how I contacted you. I was giving this information by an activist from my country. Thanks and God bless Best regards Isaac Ezekiel Jnr
