(FROM THE DESK OF MUSA GARUBA) FROM THE DESK OF MUSA GARUBA BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO I AM THE MANAGER OF BILL AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I GOT YOUR CONTACT ADDRESS THROUGH INTERNET NET WORK SEARCH WHEN SEARCHING FOR A GOOD AND RELIABLE PERSON THAT WILL ASSIST ME IN THIS TRANSACTION. IN MY DEPARTMENT WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF 22.85M US DOLLARS ( TWENTY TWO MILLLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND US DOLLARS)IN AN ACCOUNT THATBELONGS TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DIED ON 25TH JULY 2001 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE PLANE CRASH AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT ALL HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION DIED ALONGSIDE WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM. IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL. THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINE HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAMED AFTER FOUR YEAR, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND. THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER. I AGREE THAT 30% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, IN RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND 70% WOULD BE FOR ME; THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOU AS ARRANGED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS RELATIONS OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR BANK NAME, YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE IN THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED. UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND TO YOU BY FAX OR EMAIL THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION.
