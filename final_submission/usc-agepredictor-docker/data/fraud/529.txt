please assist My Dear Friend, My name is Mr.Musa A. Zulu, the manager, credit and foreign bills in African Development Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 89-3k7-1996/adb who perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our customer, whom I could not care lessa bout, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of us$.57 m, [Fifty seven million united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name could be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than seven years, because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I got your contact through my search via business report from your web site to see if you can assist. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the application letter, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication. Yours faithfully, Musa A Zulu.
