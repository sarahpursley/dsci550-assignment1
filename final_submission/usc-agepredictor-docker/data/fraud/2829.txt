I am waiting your response Dear Friend My name is Mr. David Kofi, the regional manager of International commercial Bank (ICB) Kaneshie Branch Ghana. I am a Ghanaian married with two kids. I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us. As the regional manager of the bank, it’s my duty to send financial reports to my head office in the capital city of Accra. On the course of the last year 2005 end of the of the year’s report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made Six Million Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars (6,550.000.00) of which my head Office is not aware of and will never be aware of. I have since then PLACED this fund on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary. As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am compelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account. I intend to part with 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to assure you that there is practically no risk involved in this. It’s going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response. With regards, David Kofi _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
