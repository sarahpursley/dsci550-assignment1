reply pls!! FROM: JOHN DUF BEN DAKAR, SENEGAL AFRICA. EMAIL:johnduf232002@katamail.com Dear Beloved One. Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be wondering where I got your contact.I got your address through a personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your time to consider. My name is John Duf Ben, the eldest son of Dr.ENAGUA BEN, from Zimbabwe.During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms for his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country and because he strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father in the incident and made away with a lot of items in my father's farm. Before my father's death,he had made deposite with a Security Company in Europe, the sum of US$6.5(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).He intended to use the money in buying new machinery and to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the death of my father,l decided to escape with my other siblings to another country because of continued harassment and threat from Mugabe and his supporters,we could only get as far as the republic of SENEGAL where we are now seeking political refuge.As the eldest man in the Family, i have been making contact with the company to see how i can make the claim without going there but to no avail,i was told that the claim can only be made by me or my father's representative in thier office.This is the reason why i decided to contact you to assist us since I am not able to travel outside this country particularly to Europe where the company is located. I am seeking for your assistance to help us go to the security company as our father's representative for the claims, For your role in this transaction,my family and i have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% will be set-aside for any expenses that maybe incurred in the course of this transaction and the remaining 65% will be for my family and i to invest in any lucrative investment.All I want you to do is to help me finish this transaction and at the sametime help me to invest some of our share of the money in a lucrative business in your country. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance via my private email address: johnduf232002@katamail.com for better discussion or should incase you have any questions you would like to ask,please feel free to contact me any time via email.Thanks and God bless as i will be looking forward to your swift and positive response.Please do not fail to call on telephone: +221 4488469 Best regards, MR.John Duf Ben PLS CALL ME ON PHONE +221 4488469
