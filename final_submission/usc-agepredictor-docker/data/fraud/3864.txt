FROM: Mr.Gary William Dear Friend, Let me start by introducing myself. I am Gary William, the chief Auditor of Bank Of Scotland.I have an obscured business suggestion for you. One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued GBP Â£35,000,000.00 .(Thirty Five Million Pounds only) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past six years. >From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a citizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your perusal you can view this web site:http://news.bbc.co. uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds. Also Information from the National Immigration stated that he was also single on entry into Scotland.I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. This transaction is totally risk and trouble free as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal act. The sharing of the fund between us, is as follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my colleagues.
