In the discharge of my duty, I stumbled on this domiciliary account that has remained dormant for three years now with fifteen million dollars($15m)in it. I contacted my director and we sent out staff for enquiries and discovered that the account holder died in motor accident with the next of kin. I am writing you so that we can work with you to remit the money into your account as the next of kin. it is simple process which will take a short while to process. outside this, the bank management will confiscate the money. If I hear from you, I will tell you all you need to Know about the money. Thanks for your co-operation. Regards Alex King Le nouveau Yahoo! Messenger est arrivé !
