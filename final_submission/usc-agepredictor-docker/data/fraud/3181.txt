Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ (mrs pprisca konan) Greeting in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I am Mrs Prisca Konan, a widow to late Martins Konan. I am 69 years old, I am now a new Christian convert, suffering from long time cancer of the breast, from all indication my condition is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that I won’t live more than six months, according to my doctors. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. My late husband died on air crash when returning from a business trip in Europe to Côte d’Ivoire, and during the period of our marriage we couldn’t produce any child. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. The doctors has advised me that I may not live for more than six months, so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to the development of the church in Africa, America, Asia, and Europe. I prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $15,000.000.00 MD U.S DOLLARS, to the less privileged. Please I want to note that fund is lying in a security company and upon my instruction, my attorney, who presently is in Africa distributing relief materials to of bomb-last in Sierra-Leone, will file in an application for the transfer of the money in your name. Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be sure for the said purpose, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Christ is vanity. May the grace of our Lord Jesus the love of God and the fellowship of God be with you and your family. I await urgent reply. Yours in Christ. Mrs Prisca Konan
