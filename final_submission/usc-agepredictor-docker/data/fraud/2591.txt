I want you to assist in a business venture involving Â£ 35.700,000.00USD Thirty Five million seven hundred thousand Pounds from a deceased customer(BANK OF SCOTLAND,LONDON) I am seeking for a reliable person who will be capable to provide either an existing bank account or set up a new or empty Bank account immediately to receive this fund. I am Dr Bruce williams, Chief Executive of Corporate (BANK OF SCOTLAND,LONDON).An accountant and bank manager, During the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in adomiciliary account opened in the bank in 1997 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account, After going though some old files,i discovered that the owner of the account who is a foreigner died without any traceable next of kin hence the dormant nature of the account and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be re-channeled into the bank's reserve. You will be given 15% of the total amount, 80% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of this transaction. I look forward to your earliest reply. Dr Bruce williams
