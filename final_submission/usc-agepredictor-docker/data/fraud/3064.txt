GREETINGS GREETINGS! Dear Future Partner, This is Mr. George Brown. I work for UBS Investment Bank in Channel Island. I also head the Treasury Bill Unit of the Bank as the Fund Manager Executive.However, all our Investors Treasury Bill Funds are directly under my management and administration. On this note, I have taking the advantage of my position to trade on our Investors Funds under private arrangement with some Private Lending Companies and have so far made the sum of Â£21.7M representing the 16.1% interest rate of the traded funds with the Private Lending Companies. In addition, the aforementioned funds are currently lying as a Floating Capital in our Treasury Bill Magellan Trust Account. Nevertheless, I am not permitted by law to own the above funds as my personal funds without declaration of source and origin of the funds to my Government and to the Management of UBS Investment Bank Group.Therefore, I would like to strike this deal with you by presenting you as the beneficiary of these funds for instant claiming and wire transfer to your nominated bank account oversee. I will let you know in details how this deal can be transformed to a reality,if you are interested please kindlly reply me via my private email (godbless77@latinmail.com) immediately for further details.
