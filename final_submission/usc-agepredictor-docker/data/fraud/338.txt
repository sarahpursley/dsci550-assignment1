Dear Sir, I am Mr Steve Ibeto, the personal accounting officer to Mr Williams Hales, a national of your country, who used to work with shell development company in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife And their three children were involved in a car accident along sagbama express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace any of his relation but to all avail.After investigation,i discovered that his next of kin dead along with him during the accident Hence i have contacted you to act as his next of kin to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly,the Zenith International bank plc where the deceased had an account valued at about 5.5million dollars has issued me a notice as his accounting officer to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated within the next ten official working days. since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now i seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same surname so that the proceeds of this account valued at 5.5million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Thanks and God Bless Best Regards.
