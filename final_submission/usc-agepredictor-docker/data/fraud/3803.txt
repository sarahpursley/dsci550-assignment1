His Excellency who is currently behind bars at a U.N.-backed court in Hague Netherlands, facing 11 counts of war crimes during the country's 1991-2002 civil war.

The new government in Liberia lead by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sir leaf has initiated moves to probe Mr. Taylorâ€™s governance while in office with a view of recovering his assets and deposits and repatriating such to the country as was the case with the Late Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha as advised by the International Community on Liberian Government. On the wake of hostilities in Liberia and the break out of war between the rebels and the allied forces, the Liberian government being under an arms embargo by the U.N could not import arms officially, so Mr. Taylor resolved to illegal arms deal from the West African Region of Ghana, which was transacted by cash monies, within this period, he succeeded in depositing a total sumof USD$115M only, in cash money derived from the arms dealing custody of Security Finance Company in Accra Ghana. Which is the trust company from where the arms deal was financed? we intends to execute a deed of conveyance of this deposit to a capable and trust worthy firm or individual who will immediately effect a change of beneficiary on the deposit and release it from the custody of Security Finance Company by way of terminating the deposit contract to avoid any trace and repatriation of the deposit by the new government in Liberia. Terms of the transaction shall be discussed and agreement entered into when you indicate your ability to handle and manage funds of this magnitude under a strict confidential understanding.. Please treat as most confidential due to the sensitive information given in here strictly to you. Yours sincerely CHRIS ANDERSON Personal Aide to the former Liberian President
