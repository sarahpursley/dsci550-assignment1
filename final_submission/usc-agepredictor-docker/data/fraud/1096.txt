Particularly,the Europe based security company where the deceased had deposited about(US$25M)Twenty Five Million United State Dollars has issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the funds confiscated within the next 21 working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 8 months now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at (US$25M) can be paid to you and then we can share the money.All necessary legal documents will be in place that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation and transparency to enable us see this deal through.I can guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please do get in touch with me through my confidential e-mail address: m_kelle@k.ro,for more details.
