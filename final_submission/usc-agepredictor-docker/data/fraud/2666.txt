I am the wife of late Brigadier AL-Jubril Zubairu from Dafur Region, Sudan. My name is Hajia Rakiya Zubairu Writing to you from Sudan. My son got your contact information from a business directory in Dakar Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And I on behalf of my late husband and my only son, decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$9 million dollars, from my late husband's trust account with a bank in Senegal, into your company or Private bank account. Before the death of my husband, he was a Brigadier in-charge of Arms and ammunition procurement for the Darfur Liberation Front (D. L. F.). In his will, he specifically drew my son's attention to the sum of US$9 million, which he had deposited, in the vault of a Bank in Dakar Senegal , as a family treasure, but it is truly cash while he boxed in it the bank as a family treasure due to security reasons. In fact, he said and I quote ?Â°my beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the sum of US$9 million. I deposited the said fund in a private account of a Bank in Dakar , Senegal; all the documents regarding the fund are with your mother. I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use. When we divided the money, my share was US$9 million. I did this in case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubakar your two sisters and your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care of this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters You should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of DAKAR for investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the deposit code, for you to claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint me! Good-bye. >From this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the foreign partner of my late husband. I am preparing to travel to Senegal before the transaction continues, as the war is worsening more and more. We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses that might be incurred in the course of the Transfer and the remaining 75% for the family investment abroad, which you will also assist us to materialize.
