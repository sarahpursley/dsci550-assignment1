Mr.Ajoy Sonya. Hello Dear. You will be surprised to read from me, but please consider this letter as a genuine request from a family in dire need of your humble assistance.I am Benson Dime. A Citizen of Zimbabwe,I am now seeking political assylum. I got your contact through the Information Exchange Online. I am the only Son of Sonya Michael, a wealthy black farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert Mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe. You will read more stories about President Mugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web site:<http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html> My father was accused of assisting the White farmers in fighting the government. Few weeks after his arrest, he was reported dead. The government claimed he died of heart attack and his body was never seen for proper autopsy, they buried him in the government cemetery. My father's associate Mr.Mc Graw Olds a White farmer from Britain assisted me in fighting my father's death through the Court and media. The Government saw us as a big threat to them and decided to eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and murdered in his House, but fortunately, before they came looking for me, I received the news and I left the country through the border to save my life. Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he deposited (US$ 7,000,000.00) with a finance firm,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security company organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. The government seized my fatherâ€™s farms and bank account before his arrest and Murder. He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in detention. This is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment of the fund, I am willing to offer you 25% of the total fund for your assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed. As I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this information as top secret.Pls u can also contact me through this alternative mail (mr_sajoy01@voila.fr) Yours truly, Mr.Ajoy Sonya.
