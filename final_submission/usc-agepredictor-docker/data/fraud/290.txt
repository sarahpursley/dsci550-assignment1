we need your assistance with good faith Dear, Please I am Mr Makathy Adams, the only son of late chief Adams Williams from Sierra Leone. I got your contact from the Ecowas Infomation Center in Cote d'Ivoire. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence to rely on you. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one million eight hundred dollars ($21,800,000) now in the custody of a BANK here in Abidjan to your private account pending our arrival to your country. SOURCE OF THE MONEY My late father, chief Adams Williams, a native of mende district in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my father. This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power ofthe Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our personal effects and the box containing team. My father deposited the fund for the safe custody until after the war when he will join us.

Was one of the targets looted and destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries Were attacked and killed by the rebels in November 1999 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my father death, and with the news of my uncles involvement in air crash in January, dashed our hope of survival.
