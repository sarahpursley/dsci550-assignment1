Business Proposal My name is Mr Oliver F. Paul; I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank here in Nigeria. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant Domiciliary account with a Balance of $26,000,000 USD (Twenty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of The account is a foreigner, He died in a car accident nine years ago, nobody else knows about these funds, and only a foreigner with the legal documents of the account can claim this money, so thatâ€™s why I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to provide an account where this money can be transferred. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached. I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally, I will give you 28% for your contribution and efforts. If interested and capable to assist me in this transaction, please get back to me immediately on Phone:> +234-80-42141411 I look forward to a favorable response from you through the contacts below. Yours Mr. Oliver F. P Phone:> 234-80-42141411 Email:> foliverpaul@techemail.com
