I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described here under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business Within the Department of Minerals an Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$14.500,000.00Dollars.Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign government and non-government agencies, we include our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa. We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.
