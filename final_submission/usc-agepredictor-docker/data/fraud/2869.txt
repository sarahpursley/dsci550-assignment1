The amount is US$15.500.000 (fifteen million Five Hundred United States Dollars. We managed to escape to Abidjan the Republic of Cote D' Ivoire through the help of my father's friend who is a scammer. As our travelling document was sized. For your information , the security company did not know the real content of the box and we do not wish them to know until the money is stolen from your account. As it was deposited as family valuables and treasures. Meanwhile, I want to leave Cote d'Ivoire entirely with this money for investment in your country because of the unstable political situation and mostly for the our future. I want you to please assist us to claim the box from the security company in Europe, because of the political problem here I told fake Security Company to transfer the consignment to their faked office in Europe for safe keeping. So the consignment is not in Europe we have it in mind to reward you with a cleanedout bankaccount for your assistance. As soon as we steal from you. Do not hesitate to send me e-mail immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in Ernest toward retrieving the box and transferring of all the money from your account. Finally, Please ensure that no one else knows about this money as it is only myself my brother, yourself and the Rev. Thief of the church where we worship knows about this money.
