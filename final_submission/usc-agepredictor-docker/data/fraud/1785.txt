Attn:Trusting you for our mutual benefit..... Good-day to you and compliment of the day, This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met before. I managed to get your contact details through the senegalese chambers of commerce myself and humbly solicit for your co-operation seeing that time is of importance and I am desperately looking for an honest and reliable person to assist me in this confidential transaction. My movement and that of other my sister has been highly restricted; but luckily I was able to move out from Luanda Angola capital territory and am now in Dakar Senegal. I am Eloy Sakiata Savimbi, son of the late General Jonas Savimbi; leader of Unita Rebel of Angola who died on the 22nd February 2002. Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00(fifteen million United States Dollars) in a private security trust company for safe keeping only. All the related documents are intact with me and I have currently contacted the company. My younger sister and I are in Dakar Senegal as asylum seekers pending when I get a Foreign partner; because of the monetary laws here which do not allow asylum seekers to operate any bank account. MUTUAL TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY Based on the above, I am contacting you so that you Will help me in retrieval and transfer of this fund to your account or any other designated by you for the mutual benefit of both of us and hoping that you will remain trust worthy. The fund was realised from gold and diamond sales when my late father was leading some region in our Country. If you are ready I will give you all the information needed. PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED. Yours sincerely, Eloy Savimbi Nb= You can contact me on alternate Email:(eloy_savimdev@juno.com <mailto:eloy_savimdev@juno.com>)
