My father also told me his intension to invest part of the money in collaboration with oil companies in countries like Libya, America or Europe, but unfortunately he died the way he did without accomplishing his objective as a result of the rebels attack. Having know that he will not survive from the injuries he sustained as a result of the wounds and pains inflinched on him by the rebels, then advised me to quickly and hurriedly go into his personal underground safe in our family villa and take the documents covering the deposit in the bank and look for a true and trustworthy foreigner assist me as partner to front to the bank as my late parents partner abroad for immediate transfer of the money for investment in any lucrative business of my chioce for my future welfare. Upon the instruction and advice by my father before he finally died, I therefore request your assistance to help me for onward transfer of the money to your country for investment partnership with you in any lucrative business in your country. I have agreed to give you 15% of the total sum immediately the transfer is made, while 2.5% also will be set aside to cover all the expenses you might incure on the process.
