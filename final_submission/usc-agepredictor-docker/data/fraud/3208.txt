He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.After his death in 2003, there was confusion in the entire family as regards sharing of the family assets and more also, there is envy and jealousy as it was obvious that I was my husband's favourite wife because my husband had three wife which i am the youngest and my husband was a muslim when he was alive.As soon as he passed away, coupled with the fact that, what i have and what is due to me might be taking away from me by greedy family relations whose reasons is based on family tradition and ethics i therefore decided to carefully moved out the fund which my husband deposited from the bank where it was originally deposited with the help of British diplomats and deposite it with a private organization abroad.The amount of the fund is 18 million dollars. Presently,this money is still with the the organization. I'm asking your partnership to transfer the fund to your account.I took this decision because I don't have any child and my husband relatives are not in good terms with me.I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.I am prepared to compensate you with 20%.And i have also set aside 10% for any expenses that may incure in this transaction for both parties.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the the full detail concerning this transaction.Awaiting your urgent reply through my private email address as folow( mrslisasuzuki1@yahoo.com ) Best Regards, Mrs. Lisa Williams Suzuk"
