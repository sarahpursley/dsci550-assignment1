PLEASE RESPOND Dear Sir I am Marthins Christiana. Secretary to Mr. Lendy Barrio work with Chevron Oil Development Company in Venezuela. On the 21st of April, 2005, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Caracas Express Road. Unfortunately, they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my Boss relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, hence, I contacted you to assist in claming the money left behind by my Boss particularly where the deceased deposited the US$15 Million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars only). Consequently, this Company issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin to claim the US$15 Million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars only) in their custody within the next ten official working days. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable uses this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you. Best regards.
