I am Michael Nkomo a citizen of Zimbabwe , but i am contacting from a neiboring country here in IVORY CAOST where i am now sicking political assylum. I am the only son of Kenneth Nkomo, a wealthy farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my country, Movement for Democratic Change [MDC]. My father was murdered by our wicked President, Robert Mugabe and I fled my country because I have become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in the MDC, a part wanting to end the several years of brutal dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe. You will read more stories about President Mugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web sites; http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html My father was accused of Treason and also assisting the White farmers in fighting the government. Few weeks after his arrest, he was reported dead. The government claimed he died of heart attack and his body was never seen for proper autopsy, they buried him in the government cemetery. My father's associate Mr. Martin Olds a White farmer from Britain assisted me in fighting my father's death through the Court and media; the government saw us as a big treat to them and decided to eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and murdered in his house, but fortunately, before they came looking for me, I received the news and I had to flee through the border to South Africa to save my life. My arrival here in IVORY COAST still remains like a miracle to me. Here, is my reasons for contacting you, I am having a huge sum of money in the total sum of $13.6Million presently lodge with the security company in holland,My father kept this money in in two trunk boxes in disguise as family treasures and could not bank them, because of the situation in my country. My father's business, farms and banks account were seized by the government before his arrest and murder. He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in detention and I have made several arrangements concerning the shipment of the boxes out of my country because we cannot invest it there. I was on the process when I fled the country. I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your country, so that I can arrange on how to come overto your country to invest with the fund I am willing to offer you 30% of the $13.6Million for your assistance. Please, let me know if you can assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed. As I wait for your urgent response, please treat this information as top secret.
