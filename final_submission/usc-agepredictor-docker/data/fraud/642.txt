I am the Director, fund co-ordinator of the Finance Contract Department of Nigerian Ports Authority. The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the NPA deliberately over-inflated the contact values of various contract awarded. In the course of disbursement my office was able to track down the sum of US$23.5M(Twenty Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) as the over invoiced sum. This money is now floating in the NPA domiciliary account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I and my colleagues now want to quickly transfer this fund to a safe nominated foreign account for possible investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign account because of our status as civil/public servants.
