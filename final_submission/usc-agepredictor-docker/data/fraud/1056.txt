ATTN: DIRECTOR/C.E.O My name is MR.PAUL MPOYO, elder son of MR. DANIEL MPOYO of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address. I got your address from South African Information Exchange in Johannesburg. During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all the white-owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support his idea,supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and mad away with a lot of items in my father's farm. After the death of my father, me and my mother and my younger sister decided to move out from Zimbabwe because our lives are still in danger with the money my father kept in his hidden safe in my mother's house. The amount contained in the safe is US$12.8m (Twelve million, eight hundred thousand US dollars)and we decided to move to the United Arab Emirate(U.A.E) where we deposited the money in a Security Company as valuables.So, I decided to contact overseas Firm that will assist me to move this money out of United Arab Emirate.
