I am in need to contact you on a personal basis,I have a late client who left a substantial amount in foreign exchange with my bank,and I am his account officer up until now having sought for his next of kin for the past one year I have been mandated to produce a next of kin within a provisional time of 30th days or risk national treasury confiscated of this fund. Sir,you bear the same last name as my late client,I therefore think we can do business, The amount we are looking at is eight million six hundred thousand dollars(8.6M USD).
