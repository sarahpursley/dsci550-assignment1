PLEASE URGENT REPLY From: Mr. HOFFMAN Bancoley Accra, Ghana. Attn : I got your contact during my search for a reliable,honest and a trust worth person to entrust this huge transfer project with. My name is Mr.Hoffman Bancoley, manager of the above named financial institution.I am a Ghanaian married with two kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of $4,550.000 U.S Dollars. This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager made as profit during the 2004 financial year. I have already submitted annual report for that year to my head office here in Accra as I have watched with keen interest as they will never know of this excess. I have since, placed this amount of $4,550.000 U.S Dollars on an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary (anonymous) to avoid trace. As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account on my behalf. I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It's going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund so that the fund can be transferred to your account. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to my private email.....mancoleyghanac@latinmail.com Mr. Hoffman Bancoley
