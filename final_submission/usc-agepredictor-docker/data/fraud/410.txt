ASSISTANCE FOR CHARLES TAYLOR ATTN:SIR/CEO, ASSISTANCE FOR CHARLES TAYLOR I am writing you based on recommendation, trust and confidence. My name is Mr. David Anderson, one of Charles Taylorâ€™s personal aids. I write to solicit your assistance in the investment of a total of US$17,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million United States dollar) belonging to Charles Taylor the former President of Liberia. This amount is his general savings throughout his tenor in the office as President of Liberia. But, due to the sanctions from the World Governing body, requesting him to leave the country within a certain period for the forestallment of peace and unity in Liberia, the fund was moved by him out of Monrovia to a neighboring country for safe keeping. Since we are now in Nigeria seeking asylum, we have no means of reaching the fund unless if Power of Attorney is given to a third party to administer the fund on his behalf. Thus the need for assistance from you. The terms and condition of this understanding is negotiable and very attractive. If you are interested, forward via email your full Biota (i.e.) Company name, address, private fax and telephone for further discussions or contact me on my direct private line. 234-1-7755802. Please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality. I await your urgent response. Yours sincerely, Dr. David Anderson.
