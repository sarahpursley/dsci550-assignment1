ur attention Dear friend, Greetings to you.Please pardon me for contacting you without any formal appointment or communication do consider my status as asylum seeker in Dakar Senegal.I will like to seek your assistance in receiving and investing the sum of US$4.8M held in a holding finance company in europe. The money was deposited by my late father who was killed last year by the rebels during the uprising in Abidjan-Cote d' Ivoire. He was until his sudden death a diamond /cocoa dealer in Angola and Cote d' Ivoire which is where he made his wealth. Me and my mother arrived Dakar few days ago and confirmed the validity of this deposit then decided to contact you for assistance in view of our present situations. We got your contact through the Internet data base while searching for my father's friends in your country. More details will be given to you as soon as i hear from you.Please include some of your personal details for us to establish a good business and family relationship. I look forward to hearing from you Honestly yours, Miss, Joli Hamed.
