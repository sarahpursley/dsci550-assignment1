Good Day From Taylor Dear Sir, Please read this mail with good faith. My name is Mr.Joseph Taylor, son of Mr. Charles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia. I have some money I would like to invest into your company, or where you do not want any investment into your company, I will need your assistance to make a credible investment in your country. I will appreciate it if you could please get back to me urgently as I have already moved the money to Europe, and therefore, movement would not constitute any problem. I look forward to your reply via this my private email address: joetaylor@mixmail.com Best regards, Joseph Taylor
