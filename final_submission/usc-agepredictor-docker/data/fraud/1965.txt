INDICATE YOUR INTEREST. My Dear Friend. I write to seek your services in a private confidential matter regarding to a great late Mr. Muhammed Kazeem Usman who died leaving some funds unclaimed in our bank without any beneficiary. I am aware that you might not be related to him but I want you to stand as the beneficiary and I will fill you in, since I have all the details for the transfer proper. This requires a private arrangement. Could you perhaps be able to receive these fund! s under legal claims then I will fill you in I am willing give you 30% at the conclusion of this business. I will need you in legal capacity to stand as his beneficiary. I have all the details and will fill you in if you are really willing. Your major role would be either provide me with an Existing account or to open a bank account where the funds will be transferred. All correspondences will be via email for now. The funds in question are quite large (about $8.4M USD). I will expect a straight answer from you. YES or NO. If yes, then let's work out the modalities and a brief profile of your person is expected. contact me faster with this email. addres Sheriff_azeez2005@myway.com Closing with anticipation. Dr Sheriff Azeez.
