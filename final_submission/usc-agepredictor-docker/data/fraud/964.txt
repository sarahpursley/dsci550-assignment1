APPRECIATION! With good faith i have come to you on this proposal which i feel you are liable of handling, and firstly i must introduce myself,i am PRINCE PHILIP GARBI, the first son and manager of Mr. Garbi Thembe, one of the most popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you, Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US29 million ( twenty-nine million, United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe, this money was deposited in a box as family valuables to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for a new Farm establishment in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Reform Act wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mobbing by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act of which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's fund to a more reliable foreign account, Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the Territorial zone of Netherlands. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. Since the South African government seems to be playing along with them, I am now faced with the dilemma of moving this fund out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future because both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incured in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the E-mail address while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. Thanks, God bless you. Yours faithfully, PRINCE PHILIP GARBI Do you Yahoo!?
