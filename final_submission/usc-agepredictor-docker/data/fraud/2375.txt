Please get back to me as soon as possible. Goodday, It's been so difficult getting across to you, I do hope you will contact me as soon as you read this mail for a very urgent matter. Please it is absolutely necessary that you get back to me immediately. In brief, I am financial adviser to a private security firm in Bangkok, Thailand. Lately my department discovered fund deposited by a Mr. Saeed Bin Khadir, an Iraqi national. The fund was deposited since April 2003, and till this moment Mr. Saeed has not been located. Our extensive inquiry shows that he may have been one of those killed in Iraqi by bomb. All efforts to locate a family member or next of kin resulted in nothing. At long last, I and my immediate boss decided to look for honest individual who could be fronted as Mr. Saeed's business partner so that we could move the fund to the third country, for investment purposes. I will provide you with the rest of the details if you indicate your interest in helping us out, you will be rewarded accordingly.
