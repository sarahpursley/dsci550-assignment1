I must not hesitate to confine in you for this simple and sincere business. I am Mrs Floxy Page, the legal wife of the elstwhile chief security officer to late major Johnny Page, My Husband was the former head of the presidential guard to Mr Charles Taylor the liberia president. Before the death of my Husband, on may 15th,2003 during an attempt by the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor, where he was brutally injured and subsiquently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death,he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$18Million dollars (Eighteen million dollars)that he used my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. Right now, the rebels are at war with the ! president and the America government has asked the president to step down.
