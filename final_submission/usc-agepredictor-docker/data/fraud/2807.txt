I EXPECT TO HEAR TO FROM U SOONEST. Compliment dear, Do you know late Dr. Jonathan Mann once a human right activist on HIV/AIDS who died with his family in Swissair crash in 1998? The CNN webpage below will tell you more about my client any way; http://www.cnn.com/health/9809/03/dr.mann.profile I was his personal accountant while I was working with Barclays bank Plc here in London, United Kingdom. My proposal is to seek your aid in partnership to present you as the next-of-kin of my late client so that BARCLAYS BANK will pay you the sum of US$30 million into any bank account you are going to provide. Then we will share the amount on a mutual agreed fifty/ fifty percent to enable me use part of my own share to carry out my wife kidney transplanting surgery operation. This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, now and thereafter. Also, details about this business and statement of account of my client will be sent to you as a proof of trust as soon as I hear from you stating your wish/ interested in helping me. However, this venture will establish a verbal telephone communication to each other and this will bring you into a much better picture of the deal. PLEASE REPLY ME THROUGH MY SECURED EMAIL ADDRESS: SMITHPRIVATECEAR@YAHOO.CO.UK-: I wait to hear from you. Yours, Mr. Alex Smith. Yahoo! Music Unlimited - Access over 1 million songs. Try it free.
