Nation Wide Finance Mr. Zivko Jannes, Nation Wide Finance. Dear Sir, I am one of the transfer officers of Nation Wide Finance London and my name is Mr.Zivko James, a citizen of Macedonia. Please permit me to make this plea to you and if interested, do not hesitate to get back to me via my email immediately for further action. Last 4 years, a group of men from Africa were able to move the sum of $15M (Fifteen Million Dollars Only) to one of our branch here in London and since then, none of them have shown up to lay claims on the said amount. Several calls have been made to the owners and none was successful on the numbers given and now I have all the paper work to transfer the funds via our payment office in Berlize to your account without any trace as all documents will be destroyed by me immediately the transfer is taken place after 5 days of receiving your details. Just few days I discovered from the right source that the owner of this money is dead and I have gone through his file and have discovered that he has no Next of Kin to inherit his money. I want to use you as the Next of Kin to enable me transfer the funds ($15M) to your account immediately. Please this is very confidential and must not be discussed with anyone else as I have prepared all my documents to effect the transfer to your account once I have made all changes on the account. Also you will assure me that you will not disappear with the funds hence I make this plea in good faith.I have all the documents gotten from the Registry to put you in place as the Next of Kin. The funds will be shared on 60-40 bases to avoid greed on both sides. If you are interested, get back to me with your contacts now and we shall get this done. Please it is very important to send your response to my private email address:zankjamm@myway.com Yours faithfully, Mr.Zivko Jannes London-England Reply here only:zankjamm@myway.com
