I NEED YOU TO BE MY Partnership. My Dear, In order to transfer out Â£15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling)from our bank here I have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. My name is Steven Douglas I am the Group Finance Director here in Bank of Scotland United Kingdom.There is an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2001, no body has operated on this account again,after going through some old files,I discovered that if i do not remit this money out urgently the money will be their for Nothing, please know that 40% will be for your share, all so 60% will be for me and my family,while 5% cater all the expenses. Regards Steven Douglas London.
