How Are You Doing Today? My Dearest One , It is my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I am,intend to establish in your country. Though I have not met with you before but I believe, one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life. There is this amount of FIFTEEN Million US Dollars ($15.000.000.00) which my late grand father deposited with a security company in Abidjan Capital city of Cote d'Ivoire which he wanted to used for his political ambition in our Country before he was assassinated. Now I have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons. I want you to help me claim and receive the consignment which will be sent to you through diplomatic means to your address to avoid any traces of the funds and to enable you plan for the investment in your Country. I will like to invest part of the money into these three investments in your Country but, if there is any other business that is better than my suggestion, I will be very glad to follow your advice. 1). Real estate 2). The transport industry 3). Five star hotel If you can be of an assistance to me i will be pleased to offer to you 20% Of the total fund while the balance will be invested by you. I await your soonest response. Respectfully yours, Kuaojo Aka
