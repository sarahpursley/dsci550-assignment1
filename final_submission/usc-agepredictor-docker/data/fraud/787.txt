FROM MONICA From: Mrs.Monica Martins 23 Rivonia Road Sandton City Johannesburg South Africa Tel+27-83-238-3440 ATTN: Sir, My name is Mrs.Monica Martins, the wife of late Mr.Zulu Martins, of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address I got it from the net.I am using this opportunity to express my predicaments to you During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President ROBERT MUGABE to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My husband was one of the best farmers in the country and knowing that he did not support the president's political ideology, the president's supporters invaded my husband's farm, burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of the wounds sustained, he became sick and died after two days. And after his death I became a widow over night with my only son (Frank Martins) and one daughter (Russ) decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to South Africa. Before he died, he wrote his 'WILL' which reads: 'MY BELOVEED SON (Frank) I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF US$20.7 MILLION U.S DOLLARS WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG (SOUTH-AFRICA) IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY' you should solicit for reliable foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of SOUTH-AFRICA for the family care and investment purposes I deposited the money in your name(Frank Martins)and it can be claimed by you with the help of a foreign partner using the deposit code.Your mother has all the documents.Take good care of your mother and your sister. >From the above you will understand that the lives and future of my family depends on this money as much as I will be very grateful if you can assist us.
