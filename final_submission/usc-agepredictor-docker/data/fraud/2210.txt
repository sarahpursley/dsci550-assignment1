Mr.Dawson Higginson First Commercial Bank 29 wilson street London, United Kingdom EC2M2SJ {MONEY TRANSACTION} Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Mr.Dawson Higginson, and I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank here in London, UK On a routine inspection,I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL Of Â£12,500,000.00 ({Twelve Miliion five hundred thousand Pounds }. On furtherdiscreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead)leaving no beneficiary to the accountThe bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.If you are interested send me your private Telephone No And Fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the Deposit.I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached. And i am assuring you that the transaction is risk free hence we are going to follow the normal transfer process .Finally a 25% of the total fund will be given to you for your steadfast corporation. I look forward to a favorable response from you as soon as possible.Thank's for your maximum co-operation and remain blessed. Best Regards, Mr. Dawson Higginson.
