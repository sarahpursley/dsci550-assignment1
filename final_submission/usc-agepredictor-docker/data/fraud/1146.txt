RE:INQUIRY Good day, It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, I got your contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that allwill be well at the end of the day. I am Frank Williams, son of late Dr John Williams of Sierra Leone who was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th of December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone. When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box containing the sum of US$10,000,000.00 with one private security and safe deposit company and declared the box as containing African Artwork for export to a foreign partner. This money was made from the sale of Gold and Diamond and he already decided to use this money for future investment of the family before he died.Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to locate where my late father kept the depository agreement and the certificate of deposit that was given to him by the security company when he deposited the consignment in their custody. I have confirmed from the security company that the consignment is with them, when I demanded for the release of the consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Dr Williams, the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the absence of my father, the only person that can demand for the funds is my late father?s foreign partner on whose behalf the consignment was deposited. When my late father deposited the consignment, he did not give the name or gender of his foreign partner on whose behalf he was depositing the consignment, he made the declaration for security reasons as he did not want the securitycompany to inspect the contents of the consignment hence he declared thebox as belonging to his foreign partner. Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of his death, that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out thismoney from CÃ´te d'Ivoire immediately for investment . Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to retrieve and transfer this fund into your Account, but I will demand from you if you could be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where this fund will be invested? I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transactionbased on the trust I have established on you. For your assistance in thistransaction, I have decided to compensate you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I wouldlike you to keep this business very confidential. I shall expect an early response from you. Thank you and God bless. Yours sincerely, Frank Williams This message may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
