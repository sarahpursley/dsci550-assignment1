I Hope Our Message Meet You In Good Mood. Dearest One. I Come across your profile and have Decided to get in touch with you after the prayer,to see if you can help me and my sister solve our problem. My name is Mohamed Zahir With my sister Amina,The Son and Daughter of (Late Dr Mohamed Abdel) Who lost his life in the course of the crisis in my country Cote D'ivoire on the 7th of May last year on his way to the company ( Nestle Food Plc). My father willed in cash, the sum of $25 Million US Dollars which he deposited in a Fixed/Suspense account, with enabling conditions for the release of the fund which are as follows: (1) That we must be 22 years or above. (2) That upon request for the release of the fund, there must be evidence of investment intentions especially outside the west Africa, We contact you therefore to confirm if you can absorb us in partnership in your company or possibly advise us on any investment opportunity in your country. When we reach agreement with you, the bank will release our fund into an account that you shall nominate and we will come over to you to commence business partnership with you and the fund. We expect your urgent response including your addresses, your telephone and fax number. You can contact us through this our email: mohamed_zahir02@yahoo.com Thanks for expected cooperation.
