CRY FOR HELP My name is ROLAND DESMOND the elder son of Mr. David DESMOND of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. I got your address from the senegal Chamber of Commerce, During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in t! he farm, killing my father and made away with a lot of items in my father' s farm. Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security Company in dakar senegal sum of US$12.5 Million Dollars(Twelve million fivehundred Thousand united state Dollars). After thedeath of my father, we decided to move to the Republic of senegal dakar where he had deposited the money inthe Security Company as valuables. So I decided to contact overseas firm and companiesa that will assist me to move this money out of senegal because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any bank account within senegal. I have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction and 65% will be for me to invest in you country. All I want you to do is to furnish me with your entire personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and absolutely confidential.
