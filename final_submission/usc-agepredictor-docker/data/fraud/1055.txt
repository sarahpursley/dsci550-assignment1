please urgent Dear Sir, Good day. My name is Momoni Adoh . I am the regional manager of International Commercial Bank Takoradi branch eastern region of the Republic of Ghana (West Africa). I write you this letter in good faith. I got your contact address from a recent banking forum held in Lome the capital city of Togo our next door neighbor, hence I write you to ask for your assistance in a business venture that will benefit you and I. On January of 2000, one Mr. Dennis Burles who has been living and working in a gold company called Obuasi Goldfields died in the Kenya airways fatal air crash on the coast of Cote D Ivorie on its way to Accra the capital city of Ghana. I was the personal banker to the late Mr. Burles, before his untimely death. You see my friend, the late Mr. Burles had $3M USD deposited in a fixed deposit account in my branch, without any next of kin to inherit the sum, that is the reason I write you this letter. I need you to stand claim as the next of kin so that my bank will not declare this funds a deceased account non-grata, meaning that the bank has full and legal right to claim the funds, since the policy of the bank on deceased customer account is that after 5 years if there is no claim, the funds will be immediately taken by the bank. Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it, my yearly income is barely about $2,500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it, so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die. I am offering you 25% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account, because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim payment transfer. I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account. You can reach me on tell: +233 244231712, I have all the payment claim information worked out. Bye for now and thanks for your understanding. Best regards, Mr. Momoni Adoh
