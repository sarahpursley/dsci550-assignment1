URGENT REPLY ATTN:, I am Godwin Ekpontu Sangana, Esq., A personal attorney to MR/MRS MILLER, an expartriate formally with my country's branch of Agip Oil Company(NAOC), here in Lagos. On April 21, 1999 my client, Mr&MRS. MILLER died in a fatal automobile accident. Ever since, I have made several frantic and extensive enquiries to locate any of my late client's relatives which, to this time, has proved unsuccessful. After these unfruitful attempts, however, I decided to trace his relatives via the internet.This, of course, explains this correspondence to you. I contacted you to assist in repartriating the money left behind by my deceased client before it gets confiscated or declared unserviceable as repeatedly threatened by the bank where this deposit of a large amount of money was lodged. For purposes of security, I cannot disclose the amount until I am sure of your commitment to collaborate with me. Recently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next-of-kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 3 years of endless effort, I seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased, Mr/mrs Miller. So that the proceeds of this venture can be remitted to your nominated account for you and I. In the event that you agree to render this assistance, I propose a sharing formula of 65% for me and 30% for you,while 5% will be for all expenses and inheritance tax, as may be required by your government. I am certain that all necessary legal documents that will be used to back up our inheritance claims and secure approvals are readily accessible with little or no difficulty. All I require is your honest cooperation to see the deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate atmosphere that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please contact me by email and also send your phone and fax number for further discussions. God bless. Yours Faithfully, Godwin Sangana (Esq).
