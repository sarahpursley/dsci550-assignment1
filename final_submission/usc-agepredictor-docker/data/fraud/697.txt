Please Help Me!!! I humbly introduce myself to you; I am Mrs. Alhaja Rashidat Azmil the wife Of Captain Azmil who served in Iraq.I am contacting you base on trust and humanitarian assistance which I urgently need from you. The recent concluded US led war against my country has left my family totally devastated as I lost my Husband to the cold hands of death and the children lost thei father.Long before this war started, my late husband had in his custody $20.7 Million U.S Dollars, but due to serious threat of war from the United States and the collision forces (if our dictator president does not amend his ways), my husband had to act fast and at such deposited these funds in a Diplomatic Condominium in a neighboring country for the purpose of our family survival after the war might have been over. I am writing you this letter because our dreams was not fulfilled as we could not leave Iraq before the war but we did however succeeded in getting the children to a neighboring country first before trying to proceed with getting ourselves out. It was in the process of us (my Husband and I) escaping to a neighboring country that we came under friendly fire. It was this mistake that took my husbandâ€™s life and critically injured me as the truck we were in went out of control into a brick wall. I was rushed to a military hospital in a neighboring country where I am currently admitted and writing this letter. I am recovering well and now that my health has improved dramatically, I need to think of the futureof my Children and who to trust in sending theentire amount kept by my late husband for investment and acquiring immigration papers for my children. If you believe you can assist me on this endeavor,kindly reply me at r_azmil@land.ru so that I shall forward to you all the details required to carry on this transaction successfully. I look forward to your prompt favorable response.Thanks for your understanding. Yours Respectfully, Mrs. Rashidat Azmil. N.B (If you have received this email in error, please accept my apology.
