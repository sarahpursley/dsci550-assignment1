YOUR HUMBLE ASSISTANCE IS HIGHLY NEEDED FROM:KEVIN KAMARA AND SISTER. ABIDJAN, COTE D?IVOIRE WEST-AFRICA TELL+22507428963 ATTERNATIVE EMAIL(k.kamara@laposte.net) Dear Director/Ceo CONFIDENTIAL Please I am KEVIN KAMARA, the only son of late CHIEF VINCENT KONE KAMARA from Sierra Leone. I got your contact from the Ecowas Infomation Center in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence to rely on you. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of Ten Million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars($10,5000,000.00) now in the custody of a BANK here in Abidjan to your privateaccount pending our arrival to your country. SOURCE OF THE MONEY My late father, chief Vincent Kamara, a native of mende district in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my father. This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our personal effects . My father deposited the fund for the safe custody until after the war when he will join us. During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the sierra Leone mining co-op was one of the targets looted and destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attacked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my father death, and with the news of my uncles involvement in air crash in January, dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her. Now my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orphans. Our only hope now is in the fund our father deposited in the BANK. To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. To assist me claim this fund from the BANK as co-beneficiary. To transfer this money in your name to your country. To make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country with you as the caretaker.To secure a college for my little sister and my self in your country to further our education. And to make arrangement for our travel to your country after you have transferred this fund. Most importantly. The whole documents issued after deposit is in my custody. For your assistance, I beg to concede 10% of this money to you for your assistance . Best regards KEVIN KAMARA AND SISTER. ________________________________________ Crea la tshirt con il tuo nick! http://www.mediasetshop.it/JumpyChat/
