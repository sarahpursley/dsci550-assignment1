GOOD MORNING Dear friend, Acting on consent and high recommendation from close associates I hereby contact you in the matter of an urgent confidential business transaction. Before I proceed further let me introduce myself, my name is Mr william okafor and I am part of a group of five government officials still in active government service in different government parastatals, collectively we are members a special commitee formed by the present democratic government .The purpose of this commitee is to monitor the privatisation of some government parastals of which the Nigerian Electric Power Autority (NEPA) is one of such parastals. We have sucessfully amassed the sum of Twenty Three Million United State Dollars ($23million) for ourselves which was accrued as a result of over-invoiced reciepts from sales of shares of other government parastals. We intend to transfer this fund out of this country to a foreign offshore account, but being that we are still in active government service, we are not allowed to transfer any money or own foreign accounts. Inlight of this we have decided to solicit for your assistance in the provision of a foreign account where we can transfer this fund to. For your assistance we have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund, which is Four Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars($4.6million), 70% will come to I and my colleagues and the balance 10% has been set aside for any expense incurred in the process of this mutually beneficial transaction. We assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely legal.However due to the sensitive nature of our position in government service we implore you to keep this highly confidential. You will be given more details when you contact me on my email I await your immediate reply. Best regards. william okafor.
