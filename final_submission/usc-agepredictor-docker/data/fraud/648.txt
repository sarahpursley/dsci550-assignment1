STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT ..PLEASE JOIN HANDS WITH ME DR H.B OHAMS Accountant, The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) LAGOS,NIGERIA . STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT I am DR H.B OHAMS,one of the very many accountants of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals. There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of multinationals in the oil ndustry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The original value of some contracts done for my corperation were delebrately over invoiced for OUR own use in the sum $29mUSD (twenty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned. It does not matter whether your company did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other ompanies. Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of onduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. WAITING FOR YOUR RESPONSE.THERE AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS. THANKS DR H.B OHAMS Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save Â£7.50 a month www.freeserve.com/anytime
