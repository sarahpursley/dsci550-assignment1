ATTENTION Dear Sir, I Am Mrs. Safinatu Al Mustapha The First Wife Of Major Al Mustapha The Chief Security Officer (Cso)To Major General Sani Abacha Who Diedin Office . Since The Death Of The President, The Present Nigerian Government Of General Olusegun Obasanjo Has Done Virtually Nothing Except To Hunt Down The Family Of The Late President And All Those Associated Withe Him.The Government Has Seized And Frozen All The Assets And Funds Of The Abacha Family And His Associates. You Can Visit The Following Websites For A First Hand Information On This: Http://Allafrica.Com/Stories/200203180074.Html Http://Www.Time.Com/Time/Europe/Magazine/2000/27/Swiss.Html My Husband Has Been In Detention For The Past 3 Years After Forfeiting His Assets To The Government. All His Known Bank Accounts Are Presently Frozen And This Has Made It Very Difficult For Us To Fight His Various Court Cases With The Present Government And Life In General Is Becoming Unbearable For Us. When This Whole Saga Began, My Husband Did Not Take It Serious Thinking That He Will Be In Detention For A While And Then Regain His Freedom But To His Chagrin, He Has Been Held For 3 Years And Now The Funds He Left With Us Has Been Exhausted By Attorney Fees. Although The Government Froze His Accounts And Seized His Properties, But Unknown To Them My Husband Had Some Funds Stashed In Safe Deposit Vault With A Security Company In A Neighboring Country. The Amount Of This Deposit Is Us $60 Million And Was Given To Him By The Late President For Safe Keeping Outside The Country Before His Death. My Detained Husband Has Asked Me To Seek The Assistance/Collaboration Of A Foreigner To Help Me In Securing The Release And Eventual Transfer Of This Money Oversee To Ensure That The Nigerian Government Does Not Seize It Equally. This Is Why I Am Contacting You To Assist Me In The Release And Transfer Of This Money To Your Country For Safe Keeping. Because Of Restriction On My Movement Here, My Husband Has Advice Me To Use The Services Of My Personal Lawyer To Liaise With You On This Transaction To Ensure That I Am Not Cheated In Any Way given Our Present Circumstances. As Compensation For Your Envisaged Role In This Transaction, My Husband Has Asked Me To Offer You Us $6.0 Million As Fees, This Should Be Deducted From The Deposit Upon Withdrawal. Your Envisaged Expenditure In Securing The Release And Transfer Of This Money Is To Be Tabulated For A Refund Upon Transfer. Please Help My Family Out Of Our Present Ordeal By Treating This Transaction With Utmost Secrecy . Please Forward Your Observation Through My Lawyer Who Is Better Placed To Plot The Logistics With You. My lawyer Is Barr.
