E-mail Back in this(n13din5@yahoo.co.in) {THIRTY SIX MILLION USD) (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 36,000,000.USD {BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY/YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED} My name is Mr.Ben Otutu. and I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred. If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached. The informations will be as follows....... Bank Name......... Bank Address........ A/C Name............. A/C Number.............. Swift Code No.............. Routing Number................ I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I will give you 25% for your corporation. I look forward to a favorable response from you. Thank's for your maxinium co-operation and remain blessed. Best Regards, Mr.Ben Otutu. Aktivujte si neobmedzenu mailovu schranku na www.pobox.sk!
