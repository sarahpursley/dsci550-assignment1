Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of our clients extended relatives, this has proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any of his family member but of no avail. hence I contacted you for similarety of your name with that of our late customer. I need your assistance in evacuation of the funds left behind by our client in the Bank before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Government, because official, financial laws here stipulate it that after five years any fund or assets deposited with bank/security firm without claim or servicing, the money or assets will be divert to central bank as unclaime bill. since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your concent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this deposit valued at $6.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you will share me part of the money, I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this business will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. You have to assure me that you will not sit on the fund when it is finally claimed. expecting your quick response Best regards,
