Note carefully the content of the crate is MONEY but I did not disclose it to the Courier Services as Money,rather I informed them that the crate contain Vital ANTIQUES belonging to my client (that is you). Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 220kg but I manage to pay 120kg, which cost US$16,000.00. On no account should you disclose the content of the crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of betrayal. So do not allow them to know that the content is money.In the meantime, contact the DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICES LONDON U.K on Tel: to know the actual situation with the consignment and also give them your details and address where the consignment will be delivered and then get back to me as soon as possible to enble me forward you the shipping documents that will legally emback with the receipt/claim.
