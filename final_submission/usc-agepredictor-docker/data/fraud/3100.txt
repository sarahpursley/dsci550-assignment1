From Cynthia. >From Cynthia. Dearest one, GREETNGS, Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I am Cynthia Bouabre, the only duaghter of late Mr. and Mrs. George Bouabre. My father was a very wealthy Farmer/Gold merchant in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their business outings. When my mother died on the 21st October 1989, my father took me special because I'm motherless. Before the death of my father on september 2004, in a private hospital here in Abidjan. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of US$5M (five million US dollars) deposited in a security company here in Abidjan, that he used my name as his duaghter for the next of kin in deposit of the fund. He told me that the security company do not know that the consignment contains money because he registered it's contents as family valuables and african artworks. He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of money his business associates supposed to balance him from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose,(such as real estate management). I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways. To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to. Moreover, I am willing to offer you 15% of the sum as compensation for effort/input after the successful transfer of this deposit to your designation. Anticipating to hear from you soon. Please try and respond to me as soon as you recieve this email for further details. Thanks and God Bless. Best regards. Cynthia Bouabre. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Hotmail : créez votre adresse e-mail gratuite & à vie ! http://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f
