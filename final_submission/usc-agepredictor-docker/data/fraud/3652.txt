Dear Friend, I am Mr. Stark William, the senior credit officer of NATWEST BANK PLC.I have three more months in this office and as such i am informing you for a reliable partner concerning a project in this bank which will be of great benefit to our families. After the United States and Iraqi war, our client Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, with a value of Â£25,000,000 (Twenty Five Million British Pounds) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even in the first quater of this year. Again another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Deputy Governor has been assasinated in Baghdad. The websites below is a proof and verification of the news about his death: http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979 After further investigation it was also discovered that Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.
