Respond Soonest! My Valued Friend I am Mr. Mike Ato, a Regional Branch Manager, International Commercial Bank ltd, Ghana, West Africa. I write you this letter in good faith and trust and expected you to keep it confidential. Also I hoped you will not be embarrassed as why I contacted you. I have that conviction to contacted you hoping all will be with your full co-operation. I am in control of the sum of one million, eight hundred and fifty thousand US dollars ($1,850,000),an excess profit made by our regional branch in the last quarter of the year 2004. I have carefully placed the fund in an Escrow Call Deposit Account and did not declare it to my head office, while accounting for the end of the year fiscal profits. Can I really trust you to hold this money for me until I arrive your country and pick it up myself and you deduct 30% of the total money as your remuneration? If you accept my offer you can contact me immediately. If you do not accept can you forget I contacted you? I want you to get me a good current account in your country where I can move this money. I will discreetly give you all the information concerning the account so that you can apply to our Head Office for the transfer of the money to your account. You shouldn't be afraid, as it will be just a smooth bank-to-bank transfer. There is practically no danger to your person. I am hoping for your perfect understanding of my situation and position. Thanks Mike
