I got your address from the South African Chambers of Commerce through a reliable source I am FELIX TAYLOR; the younger brother of to the Ex. President of LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR, the Ex. President TAYLOR is being step down as the president of Liberia. He has resigned and seek asylum in Nigeria country due to pressures mounted on him by the international community especially the UNITED STATE OF AMERICA. My Brother has resign as president in order to give peace a chance in our country Liberia. CHARLES TAYLOR has been a freedom fighter that fought all his life for the well being of Liberians. But due to the multi tribal nature of our country, REBELS From the enemy tribes have fought the ruling government of CHARLES TAYLOR, to the point where it has become impossible to maintain peace and tranquility. Presently we want to have some more time to relocate our wealth from Liberia to other foreign countries, where we can secretly invest our wealth profitably and peacefully. As of now, the president is now in NIGERIA where he is on asylum, the rest of our family including my three brothers and wife and children have left Liberia to seek refuge in foreign countries where they can have security and peace of mind. I am currently living in South Africa where I am living in asylum as a political refugee. This is why I am writing you. On my arrival to South Africa, I come with the sum of US$18,000,000,00 (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) This money was given to me by Ex. PRESIDENT TAYLOR to buy military arms and ammunitions from South African allies. These ammunitions were meant to be used to curtail the insurgence of rebel forces into the capital city of Monrovia. Ex. president Taylor therefore instructed me to find a reliable partner that will assist me to transfer this money to a foreign account for my personal use. Currently the money is deposited in a private security company here in South Africa as classified consignment. And the security company does not know the real contents of this consignment. I simply deposited the money as diplomatic valuables to avoid the security company from interfering with the money. I shall want you to help me transfer this money overseas. I will appreciate if you can provide me with a bank account in a stable bank where we can transfer this money. I shall also want you to assist me in investing this money in any profitable venture for the future of my family. I am fed up of the disorganization and political instability of this CONTINENT thus I shall want to relocate my fund and my family to an oversea country where peace, security, political stability as well as financial consistency are all guaranteed. You will be given a commission for your assistance and other details of this transactions will be discussed when I receive your reply indicating your interest and readiness to assist me. I must also assure you that this transaction is totally legal and bears no risk whatsoever now or in the future. I have all the documents covering this money which I can send you if you desire. My family friends in the government and banking sectors here in South Africa will also help to make this transfer successful within the shortest time in the most legal way. They have assured me of their support. ALL I ASK FROM YOU ARE TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY. YOUR TELEPHONER AND FAX NUMBERS IS URGENT You are therefore to contact me immediately with the contact details provided above to discuss further details regarding this transaction. Thanks as I look forward to immediate response. Yours Sincerely FELIX TAYLOR CaraMail, le seul webmail à vous offrir des fils d'info RSS sans aucun logiciel à installer!
