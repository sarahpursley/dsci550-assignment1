During our investigation and auditing in this security company my department came across a consignment belonging to a deceased person who died on plane crash with this security company without any claim of the consignment in our custody either form his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and ides be profitable and successful during the time if execution, the said amount was US$5.6M (FIVE Million SIX Hundred thousand United State Dollars).

Mean while all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the deceased, will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great deal. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this company. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the security company and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by designation back account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% we be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the fine of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and by partners. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will write application to rinsing out have the company and join business. And it will require us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of this found according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I heard from you I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal. <mailto:wilsonjohnbeney@yahoo.com> Yours faithfully, Mr. Biney Isaac.
