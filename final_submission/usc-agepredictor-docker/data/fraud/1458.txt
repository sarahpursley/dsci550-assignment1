The Government had already concluded plans to freeze all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal and have on the 18th of October 2004 decided to sell off the assets of all Yukos Oil corporation at a give-away amount to pay the allege taxes which the company owed the Russian Government.refer to the website again. Everybody in the world know that this is a political vendetta to ensure that Mikhail Khodorkovsky comes out of detention as poor and broken man and his companiesare liquidated, that if he is not eventually sent to jail for tax evasion. The Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this transaction) and I have decided to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the above amount which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations. Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because they agitated for their payments when they heared that my boss was arrested and might eventually be jailed by the RussianGovernment. YOUR ROLE: I will present you/your company as one of the contractors we are owing so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your company. I will arrange for the documentation which the payee bank will need to transfer the sum to you. The transaction has to be concluded before as soon as possible. You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?
