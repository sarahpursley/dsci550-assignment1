Hello, Please Treat ASAP. I am Ms. URLIKA OMERZEL JAGODIC, personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky the founder and owner of YUKOS OIL of Russia, (Russian Largest Oil Company). I apologized using this medium to reach you for a business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. I seek your assistance to accommodate the sum of US$23M (Twenty three million (US) dollars) for us, and the need is very urgent. I will reward you with 20 percent of the fund for your assistance. My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics in financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov), which posed a threat to President Putin Leadership, and was charged with Tax invasion, just to get him out of the way. The Russian Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with an high ranked official of YUKOS OIL,(who is also my partner in this business) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe a foreign contractor the sum of 23m US dollars which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations, by the Government of Russia. YOUR ROLE: My contact in Yukos Oil will present you as the foreign beneficiary of the above stated sum. He will also arrange for the documentation which the payment center will need to transfer the sum to you. The business is 100% safe, Also, your area of trade or specialization is not an hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Please, endeavour to contact me immediately through my Email: urlikamerzel@netscape.net I wait in anticipation for your reply. Regards, Ms.URLIKA OMERZEL JAGODIC
