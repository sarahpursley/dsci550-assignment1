Confidential Mr. Kenneth Iloka Block 4,NNPC Quarters Falomo Crescent Ikoyi - Lagos Tel:234-1-776 4163 Fax to 234-1-759 4377 Email:ke_iloka1965@themail.com Dear, I am Mr. Kenneth Iloka, Personal Assistant to Alhaji Rewani Lukeman, the Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Matters. My message to you is based on some money that floated into the Government treasury due to the recent boom in the International Oil Market. The Federal Government of Nigeria budgeted US$18.00 per barrel in last Year budget, but the price was changed in the international oil market where a barrel was sold between US$28-US$35.00. We recorded Excess gain, and all these could not be accounted for, hence some executive members in the Petroleum Ministry decided to take away the sum of US$18,532,700.00, (Eighteen Million Five Hundred and Thirty Two Thousand Seven Hundred United States Dollars) to an offshore account of a foreign National or company. Please we are not contacting you because we cannot do this business on our own successfully, but because we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts as civil servants, that is why we are looking for a foreigner we can use and knowing fully well that as a white man, the movement of the fund will raise no doubt that is why we have decided to contact you. If you are interested to assist us, please let me have your personal telephone, fax and email address, so that I can furnish you with further details on the modalities of the transfer of the fund into your bank account. Please you are advised to keep this matter to your self, as we do not want it to be exposed in order not to jeopardize our chances of succeeding. Let it be known to you that this transaction is hundred percent risks free and your security has been well taken care off. If you are interested in this transaction, call me immediately through my private telephone number 234-1-776 4163 or send me a email to ke_iloka1965@themail.comfor further clarifications. Best regards. Mr. Kenneth Iloka Tel:234-1-776 4163 Fax to 234-1-759 4377 Email: ke_iloka1965@themail.com
