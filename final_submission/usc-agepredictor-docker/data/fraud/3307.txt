Your Advice From Mr. Peter Please Reply Back Now!!! From: The Manager, International Commercial Bank Ghana First Light Branch Accra, Ghana. My Dear Friend, This proposal is real and I want you to consider it very important and I am assuring you that it is not a joke or anyhow letter. I got your contact during my search on the Internet. My name is Mr. Peter Kwaku. I am the manager of the International Commercial Bank Ghana, First Light Branch. I am a Ghanaian married with two kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of US$ 3,550.000.00. This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am manger made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved End of the Year report for the year 2005 to my Head Office here in Accra and they will never know of this Excess. I have since then, placed this amount of US$ 3,550.000.00 on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary. As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account. I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It¡¯s going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund. PLEASE REPLY BACK TO ME ON: kwaku_petergh@yahoo.com <mailto:kwaku_petergh@yahoo.com> If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response. With regards, Peter Kwaku.
