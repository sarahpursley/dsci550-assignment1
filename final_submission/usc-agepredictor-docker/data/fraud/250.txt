DEAR PARTNER DEAR PARTNER, I GUESS THIS LETTER MAY COME TO YOU AS SURPRISE SINCE I HAD NO PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU. I AM THE CHAIRMAN TENDER BOARD OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC). I GOT YOUR CONTACT IN THE COURSE OF MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE PERSON WITH WHOM TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE TRANSFER OF THE SUM OF $30,000,000.00 D0LLARS (THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) INTO YOUR PRIVATE ACCOUNT FOR SAFE KEEPING THE ABOVE FUND IN QUESTION IS NOT CONNECTED WITH ARMS, DRUGS OR MONEY LAUNDERING. IT IS THE PRODUCT OF AN OVER INVOICE ON CONTRACT AWARDED IN 1999 BY INEC TO A FOREIGN COMPANY FOR THE SUPPLY OF ELECTORAL MATERIALS THAT WAS USED FOR CONDUCTING 1999 ELECTION. THE CONTRACT HAS LONG BEEN EXECUTED AND PAYMENT OF THE ACTUAL CONTRACT AMOUNT HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FOREIGN CONTRACTOR LEAVING THE BALANCE OF US$30MILLION DOLLARS IN A DORMANT ACCOUNT, WHICH MY COLLEAGUES AND I NOW WANT TO TRANSFER OUT OF NIGERIA INTO A RELIABLE FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR OUR PERSONAL USE. AS CIVIL SERVANTS WE DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FOREIGN ACCOUNT MACHINERY TO SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION THEREFORE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SOURCE FOR A FOREIGN COMPANY OR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE CAPABILITY TO ACT AS THE ORIGINAL BENEFICIARY OR THE CONTRACTOR. MY DEAR, IT IS A GOOD THING THE PRESIDENT HAS ENDORSED THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE SENATE THAT ALL FOREIGN CONTRACTORS OWED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA SHOULD BE PAID. WE WILL SEIZE THIS GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT YOU AS ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES TO BE PAID. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROPOSAL KINDLY GET BACK TO ME BY SENDING ME YOUR LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE ALONG WITH YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS, BUT IF YOU CANNOT FOR ANY REASON TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL, IF YOU CAN INTRODUCE IT TO A RELIABLE AND TRUST WORTHY PERSON IN WHICH IN ANY CASE YOUR INTEREST WILL BE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF. MEANWHILE, MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE THE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING RATIO: 60% FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND I, THEN 30% FOR YOU THE ACCOUNT OWNER AND 10% FOR ALL LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION. FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDENCE. THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUT 100% RISK FREE. NOTE ALSO THAT THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND THIS TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCLUDED WITHIN 21 WORKING DAYS SINCE ALL LOCAL CONTACTS AND ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY PERFECTED FOR A SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THISTRANSACTION. CONTACT ME VIA EMAIL WITH YOUR CONTACT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS, SO THAT I CAN CALL YOU FOR A DISCUSSION. THANK YOU AS I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE. YOURS FAITHFULLY, FREDRICK MBONU
