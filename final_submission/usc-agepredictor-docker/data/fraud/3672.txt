Re: Your Kind Attention Needed Re: Your Kind Attention Needed Dear Friend, My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30, 2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit, but none has surfaced. The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for our mutual benefit. If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the deceased which contains every needed information about the account and the deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have enough information to support you in claiming the inheritance. The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after expenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on chriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for the claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten working days. Please kindly get back to me urgently so that we will discuss more on this issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and fax numbers for easier communication.
