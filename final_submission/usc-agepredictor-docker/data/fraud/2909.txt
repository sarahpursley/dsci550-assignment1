I NEED YOUR SINCERITY AND TRUST. Dear Friend Good day to you, My name is Irvin Shawn I am an American soldier, serving in the military with the Third infantry Division in Iraq. Three years ago, we discovered some huge amount of money in Baghdad neighbourhood belonging to Saddam Hussein, I smuggled some part of these funds in two trunk boxes out of Baghdad, which is being kept safe in a secured finance company in Europe. You can go to this web link to read about events that took place here: <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm> Basically, am writing you due to the situation I found myself and can not return back to America again because I was among five US soldiers questioned by military officials after some of that money was allegedly stolen, as I have absconded from US military and am now in exile. I have killed in war and I found no peace anymore in where I am right now as I have been declared wanted by US Military.I have decided to look for someone like you to help me retrieve these funds from Finance Company in Europe and disburse this funds to any charity organisation on earth as I know that this will only be a way Almighty God can forgive me in all human killing I encounter during war. In honesty, after claiming these two trunk boxes from security company in Europe, you shall have 50% of total funds, disburse 50% to five charity organisations on planet earth. Each box contain the sum of fifteen million United States Dollars.
