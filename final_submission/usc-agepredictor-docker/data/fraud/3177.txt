EMAIL YOUR RESPONSE Dear Friend, Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal Ethics. I introduce myself as Mr. Andrew Gama staff in the accounts management Section of a well-known bank in South Africa. One of our accounts with holding balance of Â£15,000,000 (Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in the past 3 years. From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account is a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of January 2002 on a planecrash in Birmingham UK. Since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money as he has no family Member who is aware of the existence of either the accountn or the Funds.Information from the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into South Africa. I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other Illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you. Regards, MR ANDREW GAMA a.gama0@yahoo.com.hk
