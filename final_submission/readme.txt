To run code:

This zip file contains everything that is needed to run our code. The datasets that we pulled from the internet are included in the /data folder. You will need to ensure that the directory you are reading the notebook from also contains the /data folder. The Jupyter Notebook assignment1.ipynb contains all of the code written for this project. If you don't already have the libraries that we have used that don't come pre-installed in python, you can `pip install xx` these libraries one by one or we have included lines in our notebook that install all of the necessary libraries for you.
