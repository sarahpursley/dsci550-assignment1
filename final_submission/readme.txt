To run code:

This zip file contains everything that is needed to run our code. The datasets that we pulled from the internet are included in the data/ folder. You will need to ensure that the directory you are reading the notebook from also contains the data/ folder. The Jupyter Notebook assignment1.ipynb contains all of the code written for this project. If you don't already have the libraries that we have used that don't come pre-installed in python, you can `pip install xx` these libraries one by one or we have included lines in our notebook that install all of the necessary libraries for you.

Olivia Fryt: Used Tika to convert messages to JSON and identify message body language, attributed email attachments to parent messages, keyword scanning for social-engineering type classification, extraction of attacker titles, message urgency scores, k-means clustering "discovery" for attacker offering, attacker's geolocation identification with GeoTopicParser and IP address lookup, attack date & time identification, evaluation of ratio of misspellings, age prediction, dataset #4 Google Earth Engine, Tika Similarity, saving data to TSV.
Sarah Pursley: Identified Enron dataset and identified many new features while comparing spam emails vs. ‘real’ Enron emails, compiled and structured final notebook from all python scripts created by other group members.
Madeleine Thompson: Identified two additional datasets and appended extracted features to emails dataset and added information about if sender’s IP address was involved in any other known phishing attacks.
Claudia Winarko: Conducted sentiment analysis on the email corpus, contributed to keyword scanning for attacker’s title and type, and helped run age predictor.
Amber Yu: Interpreted data and wrote final report, included visualizations.
